              <p class ="aboutMe">I think I was born to be an engineer. Ever since I was a kid I was interested in understanding how things work and how to improve them.
                  I have a passion for software development as I believe that it represents the ultimate tool for solving the modern day challenges.
                  Now, my ultimate dream is about building something new and exciting to make a positive impact in the world.</p>

                <h3>Probably the best skill there is, it's <u>learning</u> ... </h3>
                <p>One could refer to something specific like automation, or programming languages (C++, JS, LabVIEW), but I prefer saying that my best skill is at discovering
                    what else is there, looking a little bit further ...

                <h3>... and curiosity</h3>
                <p>Search, understand, question, create ! Solving complex engineering and programming challenges can be one of the most rewarding experiences - you learn something new and interesting, while making 
                  the world a better place in the process :) </p>
